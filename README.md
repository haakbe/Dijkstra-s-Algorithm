# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Dijkstra's Algorithm is an efficient way of computing the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. Conceived by the Dutch computer scientist Dijkstra in 1956, the algorithm (implemented by me) takes a O(m x n) time ( m = no. of edges, n = no. of vertices) but it could be improved to O(m + n) using a min priority queue.
